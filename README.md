<h2 id="project-brief">Project Brief</h2>
<p>The brief set for this project is to create a service-orientated architecture for my application, with the tools, methodologies and technologies that cover all core modules covered during training. The application must be composed of at least four services that work together.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to achieve the brief, the following requirements must be achieved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trello board</li>
<li>Relational database - with one table.</li>
<li>Clear documentation including design, architecture and risk assessment.</li>
<li>An application fully integrated using the feature branch model into a Version Control System (VCS). The VCS will be built through a CI server (Jenkins) and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.</li>
<li>When a change to the code is pushed to the VCS, webhooks must be set up for the CI server to recreate and redeploy the application.</li>
<li>The application must follow the service-orientated architecture which must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.</li>
<li>Ansible playbook must be made that will provide the environment for the application to run.</li>
<li>A reverse proxy must be set up to make the applciation accessible to the user.</li>
</ul>
